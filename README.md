# Custom Psych
this fork aims to not only fit my needs for modding/playing fnf  

but as a framework for upcoming mod/engine makers to look at for math/logic in rhythm games  
(this does not mean the project is 100% right either, i also make mistakes and have made a couple along the way (so please do not take whatever is in here as fact))

i made this mainly because every engine i've tried either
* doesn't fit my needs
* too overcomplicated
* too laggy
* doesn't fit the criteria i need it to be for a vsrg

psych fit all of those  
however it had issues i personally disliked  
both feature and source code wise

pull requests and issues are open, i'm free for suggestions/changes as it takes the workload off of me  
as i also have other projects going on at the moment

# This will never be classified as its own seperate engine, it is simply a fork of Psych Engine I enjoy working on.
