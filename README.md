# Friday Night Funkin': Psych Engine
Psych Engine serves as an alternative to other engines, aiming for easier softmodding capabilities while also enhancing the gameplay of the base game.

It is currently available on Windows and Linux.
MacOS I'm not sure on, as I don't use Mac and not anyone that I know of uses it either.

Other platforms like Android/iOS and HTML5/Web are completely unsupported, as I don't find a use for something like this on there.

To get started, either grab a build from [the releases page](https://github.com/Rudyrue/custom-psych/releases) or compile the engine yourself (refer to [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/Rudyrue/custom-psych/blob/main/BUILDING.md)).
